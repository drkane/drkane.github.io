    <div class="entry-content f4 lh-copy">
        <p>Something I've needed to do a couple of times is take a long list of names and
classify them into male and female. For example, I've looked at lists of people
who attended events to see whether they were reaching more men or women - this
then helps target future events.</p>
<p><em>Note: there are lots of reasons why this is a terrible idea. For a start, gender
is more complicated than male/female, and there are lots of reasons why a name is
a bad guide to someone's gender (<a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/">and other things programmers wrongly believe about
names</a>). 
But I've justified it here on the basis that I'm not interested in getting
100% of the genders exactly right, but instead to get a general idea of a split in
a population.</em></p>
<p>This is a good place to use a naïve Bayesian classifier. The best example of this
technique is a spam classifier - this will work out whether an email is spam, based
on comparing it to a model generated from a training data set. The "naïve" part
comes from the fact that it's simply based on words that appear in the training
data set, without considering the meaning of or connections between those words.</p>
<p>To do this I'm going to use python (3.6 to be exact) and the <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit</a>
library which has a naïve Bayesian classifier built in. It's based on the tutorial
found here.</p>
<h2>Step 1 - get some training data</h2>
<p>The training data needs to be a list of names with their genders. I've found this a
tricky thing to come by, but luckily my work with the 
<a href="http://data.charitycommission.gov.uk/">Charity Commission Register of Charities</a>
throws up a good source.</p>
<p>The large data extract they publish, under an open license, contains a list of
trustees for each charity. It's just a list of names - they hold information like
address, date of birth, etc but don't publish it for data protection reasons - but
it's possible to work out the gender of a proportion of the names.</p>
<p>Out of the X,000 names, X,000 (X%) include a title (Mrs, Miss, Ms, Mr). Using those
four titles which are gender specific and cover X% of titles used. I wrote a python
script to parse the name CSV file, look for names that start with Mr, Mrs, etc and
put them into a male list or female list. This produces lists of X male names and
X female names.</p>
<p>A couple of notes here. Like any training data set, this is not unbiased. Charity
trustees represent a particular slice of the population - people from all walks of
life are trustees, but the average trustee is older, whiter and richer than the
average person. So the names we're using are going to reflect those demographics.</p>
<p>Note too that I'm not doing anything to separate out first names and last names -
I'm just using the whole string. This means that last names will be included in
the model - with the hope that they'll be equally distributed and so won't make
a difference to the final total. But this isn't a guarantee.</p>
<h2>Step 2: training the model</h2>
<h2>Step 3: testing the model</h2>
<h2>Step 4: using the model</h2>
