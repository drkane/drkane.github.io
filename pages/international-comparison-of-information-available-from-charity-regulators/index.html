            <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This report aims to summarise the current state of data gathering and
data sharing by charity regulators in eight jurisdictions across six
countries. The charity regulators are responsible for the regulation of
charities and nonprofits in their jurisdictions, and one of the tools at
their disposal is a register of organisations. While the main purpose of
the register of charities is to provide a public record of the status of
regulated organisations, increasingly these registers and the associated
information are seen as a resource for the charity sector to use to
become more efficient and share good practice.</p>
<p>The report focuses on three areas. First, the structure of regulation in
each country is examined, then an overview of the reporting requirements
for the primary charity regulator in each country is shown. Finally the
report demonstrates how data from these regulators is made available.</p>
<p>A companion table shows the information and sources used to compile this
report, and is found in <a href="#appendix-iii-overview-of-charity-regulation"><em>Appendix
III</em></a>.</p>

Perrin, Gauri Chandra at the Marshall Institute, LSE; and Michael

<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>The results described in this report and the accompanying table show the
scope of information collected and released by charity and nonprofit
regulators. Each jurisdiction studied has a different regulatory
landscape, but there are commonalities between them, and best practice
to learn from.</p>
<p>Some cases stand out as potential examples to others. In the UK and
Australia, attempts have been made to reduce regulatory burden through
legal and technological solutions - the creation of Charitable
Incorporated Organisations in the UK means that those organisations are
accountable to one regulator rather than two, and the Charity Passport
in Australia is an attempt to help government bodies use data that is
already available, rather than ask organisations for the same
information.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, the reporting standards have started to prioritise
performance information as well as financial, and an API now allows
programmatic access to the register of charities. Finally in the United
States, a large amount of information is now available as open,
machine-readable data including details of individual grants made and
services provided by the charities, and an ecosystem of tools and
analysis has developed around it.</p>
<h1 id="method">Method</h1>
<p>This comparison is based on a qualitative examination of the policies
and procedures of charity regulators in six countries, including the
three main charity regulators in the UK. The six countries are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>United Kingdom (regulators for England &amp; Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>USA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Canada</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Australia</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New Zealand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Singapore</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each country was examined to determine its procedures and resources
across a number of different areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The structure of regulatory bodies for charities or nonprofits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reporting requirements for those organisations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thresholds and differences in reporting for different types or sizes of organisation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Availability of data about organisations, either relating to individual organisations or in bulk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Availability and reporting of data about grant-making and other funding inputs and outputs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The examination was primarily conducted by examining the websites and
other online material made available by the regulators, with some
consultation with individuals with specific knowledge of the regulatory
regimes in each country. Links to the regulators’ websites and any
charity search they provide are found in <a href="#appendix-i-regulator-and-register-websites"><em>Appendix
I</em></a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-countries-were-chosen">How countries were chosen</h2>
<p>The six countries were chosen as being broadly similar in terms of the
status of nonprofit organisations, the principles of charity regulation
and charity law and the nature of the regulators involved. The research
hopes to inform potential changes in policy and practice, by enabling
regulators with similar characteristics to learn from each other.
English-speaking countries were selected in order to facilitate the
research.</p>
<p>Future research would be expanded to cover more countries (including
non-English speaking ones) and a wider range of nonprofit landscapes and
regulator variation.</p>
<h1 id="regulatory-environment">Regulatory environment</h1>
<p>The six countries have broadly similar regulatory regimes, albeit with
important differences. Non-profit regulation covers three main
areas<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The definition and regulation of charitable activity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorporation or limited company status</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Administration of tax reliefs and incentives related to charities</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Where the countries do differ is in where these three aspects are
administered. For some countries all three are covered by one agency,
while in others they are split between two or three. And not all
charities/nonprofits will need regulation across all three areas - for
example often only organisations that incorporate as a limited company
will need to interact with the company regulator.</p>
<p>The following table shows the regulators within each of the countries
and the areas over which they have oversight (only at a federal level
where applicable):</p>

<p>An additional complication is in federal countries, where there may be
additional regulators at the state level both for charity activity and
company registration. In the <strong>United States</strong> there is some regulation
of charities at a state level (see for example in California through the
Attorney General’s office<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>), and company registration is also done at
a state level. In <strong>Canada</strong> business administration takes place at a
province/territory level, as does administration of some charitable
activities such as fundraising and lotteries<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. In <strong>Australia</strong> there
are a range of regulators at a local and state level covering legal
structures, charity regulation and fundraising<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The impact of this regulatory environment on those seeking to use data
about the sector is that it is often difficult to find one “single
source of truth” about the organisations that are of interest. For
example in the UK it is possible to access lists of registered
organisations from the charity regulators and from Companies House, but
not from the tax regulator HMRC. Some organisations are solely
registered with HMRC and thus cannot be included in analysis of the
sector as a whole.</p>
<p>A more detailed examination of the regulatory environments in six of the
jurisdictions examined here can be found in Cordery &amp; Deguchi
(2017).<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="case-study-charitable-incorporated-organisations-in-uk">Case Study: Charitable Incorporated Organisations in UK</h3>
<p>Charitable Incorporated Organisation (CIO) is a new legal form that allows non-profit organisations registered in England and Wales to get the benefits of both charity registration and limited liability in one legal form, rather than needing to register with both a charity regulator and Companies House.</p>
<p>The aim of the legal form is to reduce the bureaucratic burden on incorporated charities by requiring them to report to one regulator rather than two. The practical impact of this is that CIOs only need to report to the Charity Commission and not to Companies House. A placeholder record appears on the Companies House register of companies, but no additional information is recorded.</p>
<p>An equivalent legal form is available in Scotland - Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation (SCIO).</p>
<p>For more details on Charitable Incorporated Organisations, see Morgan (2018)</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="reporting-thresholds">Reporting thresholds</h2>
<p>Within the regulatory regime for each country, the requirements for
registration and reporting do vary according to different types of
organisation. These requirements are generally based on the size of
organisation (measured by its annual income/turnover), but may also
reflect exemptions and differences based on the type or character of an
organisation - for example for religious groups or grant-giving
foundations.</p>
<p>In terms of exemptions from registration, in <strong>England and Wales</strong>,
<strong>US</strong> and <strong>Australia</strong> religious groups are excepted from some
registration or reporting requirements. <strong>England and Wales</strong> also has a
number of exceptions covering groups like scouts, while some charities
who have other primary regulators (for example universities, academy
schools, etc) are exempt from Charity Commission regulation. In
<strong>Singapore</strong>, a “Grantmakers Scheme”<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> gives a lighter-touch
regulatory regime for grantmakers who do not raise money from the
public, exempting them from requirements that their work substantially
benefits the Singapore public and from some reporting requirements.</p>
<p>For income thresholds, there is generally a divide in the reporting
requirements for smaller and larger charities, although with some
difference in where the threshold is placed. The figure below shows the
reporting thresholds across the countries, scaled to US dollar
equivalents and presented with a logarithmic scale. These represent the
thresholds used by the main charity regulator in each case, there may be
additional thresholds used by the business or tax reporting authorities
in each jurisdiction.</p>
<p><img alt="Reporting Thresholds" src="/images/reporting-thresholds.png"></p>
<h1 id="reporting-requirements">Reporting requirements</h1>
<p>All the charity regulators shown have a reporting structure, with the
organisations they regulate returning data to them, usually on an annual
basis, to keep records up-to-date and provide a report of their
activities throughout a year. This reporting consists of broadly four
areas, with variations in the areas covered by each regulator:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Basic reporting</strong>. All charity regulators studied require some
    kind of basic annual reporting of administrative details - for
    example contact details for the charity, plus a confirmation that
    they are an active organisation. This reporting is done by filling
    in a form, with some regulators having online reporting systems
    that replace the form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Detailed reporting</strong>. For some regulators more detailed returns
    are completed expanding on the fields from basic reporting. This
    reporting tends to focus on financial variables, and provide a
    picture of what has happened during a specific period (usually the
    latest financial year). The reporting thresholds shown above
    generally control who needs to produce detailed reporting, based
    on the size of organisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Financial accounts</strong>. Regulators ask regulated organisations to
    produce annual accounts and a narrative report. The accounts are
    generally governed by one or more accounting frameworks which
    specify the contents, but the finished product is a freeform
    document rather than a form in a standard format. As well as
    financial information, the organisations are often required to
    provide a narrative summarising the activities and achievements of
    the previous year.</p>
<p>The regulators may require that documents are submitted directly to
them, or just that organisations must prepare them and make them
available to the public/the regulator on demand. For larger
organisations the regulator will generally require that the accounts
are subject to audit or independent examination and any qualifications
or concerns to the accounts from the audit process are shown in the
accounts themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Grants reporting</strong>. In some jurisdictions the regulator also
    requires that details of individual transfers are recorded,
    particularly transfers between organisations. In the US and Canada
    organisations must report to the regulator grants they have made
    to other organisations, and organisations in the US must report
    grants received above a certain threshold.</p>

<h3 id="case-study-new-zealand-outcomes-reporting">Case Study: New Zealand Outcomes reporting</h3>
<p>In 2015 new reporting standards came into operation for charities in New Zealand. The reporting standards vary across a number of “tiers” based on the size of organisation, but consist of two parts: standardised financial reporting and “performance reporting”.</p>
<p>For tier 4, the smallest organisations, performance reporting requires measuring outputs of services provided - for example the number of classes provided, or subscribers to a newsletter. For tier 3 organisations (with income between NZ$125,000 and NZ$2 million) the reporting must include a description of the desired outcomes of services. The larger organisations the reporting guidance is less prescriptive, but organisations must ensure their reporting answers the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why the charity exists, what it wants to achieve, and how it wants to do that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What the charity actually did during the year to move closer to these goals<sup id="fnref:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8">8</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as being a major change for charity reporting in New Zealand, the mandatory reporting of performance measures in this way goes further than that required by regulators in the other jurisdictions examined. When Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand reviewed the new regime one year in, they found that the reporting of outputs and outcomes was one of the key challenges faced by organisations using the standard (CAANZ, 2017).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="comparison-of-fields-collected">Comparison of fields collected</h2>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1e1shOdslUeX5pUa5ir2zXFq6vqXX4qi8"><em>Appendix
II</em></a>
shows a comparison of the fields collected by the main charity regulator
in each jurisdiction, based on the fullest level of detail collected
(this is usually the detail asked of the largest charities, so some of
the fields will not be compulsory for all charities). It is also the
case that not all the information collected by the regulator is part of
the information that is made available to the public.</p>
<p>The types of fields are split into four parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yes/no questions about the charities involvement in particular activities or policies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data about employees, trustees and volunteers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resources, including income, spending and balance sheet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other details, such as contact details and classification</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On a crude count of the number of fields, the IRS in the <strong>United
States</strong> collects the most amount of data, followed by regulators in
<strong>Canada</strong> and <strong>England and Wales</strong>. The information collected by the
IRS appears to have a different focus to other regulators, possibly
reflecting the IRS’s role as a tax authority. The fields collected are
more focussed on financial and resourcing data, and perhaps less on
governance and management of the organisation.</p>
<p>Some details are only collected by one or two regulators. In particular
the regulators in the <strong>United States</strong> and <strong>Canada</strong> are the only ones
to collect detailed transactional data on grants made, only Canada
collects information about gifts in kind, and only <strong>New Zealand</strong>
collects detailed information on the structure of charity groups.</p>
<h1 id="transparency-and-availability-of-data">Transparency and availability of data</h1>
<p>A key function of charity regulators is to maintain a register of
organisations, and in most cases to make this register public.
Historically the primary purpose of the register was to enable public
confidence by allowing them to verify that a particular organisation had
charitable status and is regulated. However, registers also have a wider
function allowing organisations and the public to understand the shape
of the charity sector and analyse the flows of money and activities
through it.</p>
<p>All the charity regulators examined allow their register of
organisations to be accessed through an online search portal. This
function fulfils the register’s purpose as a public record of
organisations, and also often allows members of the public to find
charities meeting specific criteria - such as those working in their
local area. Generally the search results in the register will link
through to a page giving details about each organisation such as their
contact details, financial details and copies of documents they have
submitted, although the exact contents of these pages varies.</p>
<p>In addition to an online search facility, regulators can also choose to
make data available through a number of different methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Bulk download of data</strong>. All regulators examined except Northern
    Ireland and Singapore provide a separate download of the data in
    bulk. In Northern Ireland and Singapore it is possible to download
    the results of a search made through the online search facility.</p>
<p>The composition and format of the bulk download varies considerably
between regulators, with most providing a simple list of organisations
and their basic details, and others providing more detailed annually
updated data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Register API</strong>. Charities Services in New Zealand and the Charity
    Commission for England and Wales both provide an API for accessing
    data on their register. The Charities Services API uses the OData
    protocol<sup id="fnref:9"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> for accessing data, while the Charity Commission uses
    the more unusual SOAP protocol<sup id="fnref:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10">10</a></sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Document retrieval</strong>. In some cases regulators make available the
    documents they ask regulated organisations to provide. For
    example, if organisations have to provide their audited annual
    accounts each year, the regulator may make these available for the
    public to download on the register search page. In some cases the
    documents may need to be processed - for example if documents were
    posted to the regulator they may need to be scanned in order to be
    available online.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="usefulness-of-data">Usefulness of data</h2>
<p>A number of factors govern the usefulness of the register data. Data
downloads should be attached to a specific licence governing what
purposes the data can be used for - a permissive licence should help
encourage an active community of analysts using the data (including
those providing for-profit services). Only England and Wales, Scotland
(both using Open Government Licence<sup id="fnref:11"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:11">11</a></sup>), Australia and New Zealand
(both using Creative Commons CC BY 3.0<sup id="fnref:12"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:12">12</a></sup>) explicitly licence their
data, although other regulators may have implicit licences as a result
of being a public-sector body publishing information. There may be
additional licencing and copyright complications from the re-publishing
of material provided by the regulated organisations (such as annual
reports) as well as privacy and data protection implications of any
personal data held in the register (such as names of trustees or contact
details for organisations that are run from a personal address).</p>
<p>Another factor in the usefulness of the data is how well documented it
is and the format of the data. To be of maximum utility, data should:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be in a non-proprietary open file format (such as CSV or JSON)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use data standards for displaying field values (no commas in
    numbers, standard formats like ISO 8601 for representing dates,
    reference to standard codelists for values like currency)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be well-documented with descriptions of how the data was put
    together and definitions for the fields.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a permissive licence for re-use (see above).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be easily downloadable, without needing to register or submit a form</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of re-using the data, the following issues could affect use of
data from regulators:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Proprietary/non-standard file formats (Charity Commission for
    England and Wales, Commissioner of Charities Singapore)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unspecified/unclear data licence (IRS in US, Charity Commission for
    Northern Ireland, Canada Revenue Agency, Commissioner of Charities
    Singapore)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lack of documentation (Charity Commission for Northern Ireland,
    Commissioner of Charities Singapore)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need to register to download (Canada Revenue Agency)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A particular issue is the non-standard date formats used by many
regulators.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="case-study-charity-passport-in-australia">Case Study: Charity Passport in Australia</h3>
<p>In 2014 the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission launched a “Charity Passport” service<sup id="fnref:13"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:13">13</a></sup>, with the explicit aim of reducing red tape for registered charities. The Charity Passport service provides FTP access that allows other Australian government agencies to access data about registered charities directly from the ACNC without needing to ask the charity to provide that information themselves.</p>
<p>The success or otherwise of this initiative has yet to be determined. A report in 2014<sup id="fnref:14"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:14">14</a></sup> suggested that use of the passport was not as widespread as had been hoped.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-the-data-is-used">How the data is used</h2>
<p>Data from regulators has the potential to encourage a active group of
organisations within a country dedicated to improving the performance of
nonprofits in that country, by building on and analysing the data that
is released. The United States in particular has an active nonprofit
analysis sector, with organisations like GuideStar<sup id="fnref:15"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:15">15</a></sup>, the National
Centre for Charitable Statistics<sup id="fnref:16"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:16">16</a></sup>, Charity Navigator<sup id="fnref:17"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:17">17</a></sup> and the
Foundation Centre<sup id="fnref:18"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:18">18</a></sup> all using data from the Form 990 to provide
information to donors and others.</p>
<p>There are examples of these types of services being provided in other
countries, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ajah Fundtracker (Canada)<sup id="fnref:19"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:19">19</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NCVO Almanac (UK)<sup id="fnref:20"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:20">20</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charity Financials (UK)<sup id="fnref:21"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:21">21</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ChangePath (Australia)<sup id="fnref:22"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:22">22</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The data can also be used by academics to research the state of the
charity sector (see for example the work of the Third Sector Research
Centre at the University of Birmingham in the UK). The data also
contributes to international efforts to improve the representation of
the charity sector within economic statistics, for example through the
work of the Comparative Nonprofit Sector Project at the Johns Hopkins
Center for Civil Society Studies in the US.</p>

<h3 id="case-study-form-990-data-in-us">Case Study: Form 990 Data in US</h3>
<p>The main reporting mechanism for charities registered with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the US is the Form 990, which collects detailed financial and administrative data from organisations, replacing not only the annual monitoring forms found in other jurisdictions, but also the annual account documents prepared by organisations.</p>
<p>While there are simpler forms available for smaller organisations, larger organisations must complete the 12-page form plus appended schedules depending on their activities.</p>
<p>The US was the only jurisdiction in those examined that collects information from charities on the grants they receive and make at the grant level, although grant-level data is collected by the Canada Revenue Agency on grants made by Canadian charities. The US information is collected by the the IRS on two schedules that are attached to the Form 990. In particular, Schedule B gives details of contributors to the funding of the organisation, while Schedule I gives details of grants of over US$5,000 made by the organisation to other organisations or individuals.</p>
<p>In 2013, a campaign to “liberate” the data found in Form 990. A report by the Aspen Institute (Noveck and Gordoff 2013) showed how the system at the time - where the IRS collected information through these forms but then only published the resulting information as image files to organisations who paid a fee. By converting these files to open data, published in standard formats, in bulk, without restriction on use, the report suggests that analysts, journalists, regulators and others could then use the data to help analyse and improve the nonprofit sector.</p>
<p>In 2016 this campaign succeeded (The Chronicle of Philanthropy, 2016) and the IRS released a bulk download facility for accessing data from Form 990 in a standard format through AWS<sup id="fnref:23"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:23">23</a></sup>. Organisations that had previously had to manually enter data from image files both expanded the amount of information they could collect and analyse, but also cut the cost of collecting and analyzing the data.</p>
<p>Since releasing the data, a number of organisations and individuals have made use of it, producing tools for extracting, cleaning, analysing and exploring the data. A selection of these tools are showcased on the data download page, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A set of tools for extracting values from the data<sup id="fnref:24"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:24">24</a></sup></li>
<li>A search engine for finding returns<sup id="fnref:25"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:25">25</a></sup></li>
<li>A guide to the data<sup id="fnref:26"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:26">26</a></sup></li>
<li>An explorer for the parsed data<sup id="fnref:27"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:27">27</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>The range of tools and analysis created by the community shows the value created by openly releasing the data.</p>

<p>In addition, there may be separate regulation of activities such
as fundraising with the public or running lotteries; and activities
like providing care or education may come with their own regulatory
regimes. These are out of the scope of this report but should be
considered when looking at the full picture of regulation of
