    <div class="entry-content f4 lh-copy">
        <p><em>This blog post is a write-up of a <a href="https://twitter.com/kanedr/status/1271395238331011080">twitter thread</a>
exploring data available. These are very rough estimates, based on data that's
available at the time of writing.</em></p>
<p>It's frustratingly difficult to find out how many charities have used the 
government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, or how many employees have
been furloughed through it.</p>
<p>For the rest of the economy, HMRC has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/coronavirus-job-retention-scheme-statistics-june-2020">produced "experimental statistics"</a>
with estimates of the number of employers and employees that have used the scheme.
These statistics are based on the data HMRC uses to administer the scheme. As well
as overall totals, they've been able to produce estimates of how use of the scheme
has varied across sectors of the economy (aka "industries", using SIC2007) and 
geography (local authorities and regions).</p>
<p>Unfortunately it's not possible to directly extract charities from this data - 
charity is a legal form, and charities work in lots of different industries as
classified by SIC2007 - health, arts, social care, education, etc. So the industry
breakdown doesn't allow charities to be identified.</p>
<h2 id="estimating-using-sector-data">Estimating using sector data</h2>
<p>However, even though the industry data doesn't allow us to directly estimate the
numbers of charity employers and employees using the scheme, we can use the
industry breakdowns as a base for some rough estimates. </p>
<p>If we make the assumption that charities behave similarly to other organisations
in their industry (which may not be true) then if we know the proportion of 
organisations in each industry that are charities, we can apply that proportion
to the number of employers and employees to make and estimate of figures for 
charities.</p>
<p>But how to get an estimate of the proportion of companies that are charities? Here
I've turned to Companies House and Charity Commission data. Using data extracts from 
these two regulators, it's possible to get a list of companies, their SIC codes (for
their industry) and whether or not they are a registered charity. From this we
can produce a list of industries and the proportion of organisations in each that are
charities.</p>
<p>But is this a fair picture? Is the number of companies a proxy for the number of
employees? Well possibly, but it's probably more complicated. We know that employees
aren't evenly distributed in any sector of the economy - <a href="https://data.ncvo.org.uk/workforce/#by-size">NCVO's data shows that 40-50% of 
employees in private &amp; voluntary sector work in organisations with more than 50 employees</a>.</p>
<p>There are lots of small charities without paid staff, and similarly there are hundreds
of thousands of small registered companies that don't employ people, or are currently dormant.
To strip these out, I used a field in the company data that describes the type of 
accounts the company last submitted - this is based on their size. But limiting it
to accounts returned by active companies, we get a better sense of the proportion
of "active" companies that are charities. </p>
<h2 id="results-of-these-estimates">Results of these estimates</h2>
<p>The two methods - using all companies and then using larger "active" companies, give
two different figures for the proportion of registered companies that are charities.
For all companies charities represent 0.7% of companies, compared to 2% of "active"
companies. The latter figure perhaps feels instinctively more correct - we know from
NCVO that charity employees are around 3% of the workforce.</p>
<p>The figures give the proportions for industries. These proportions feel correct - 
charities are concentrated in 4 SIC industries: education (20% of companies), 
health and social work (12% of companies), arts &amp; recreation (12% of companies),
trade union, religious, political and repair (8% of companies). They're also absent
where you would expect - mining, manufacturing and construction show negligible numbers
of charities (the SIC classification system is definitely not perfect in every case).</p>

<p>And using these proportions we can make estimates of the number of charities that are
using the furlough scheme, and the number of employees. Using the proportions for
all companies gives a figure of 8,000 charities and 69,000 employees, but using just
larger active companies gives <strong>22,000 charities</strong> and <strong>188,000 employees</strong>.</p>
<p>While there's a number of assumptions going into these figures, I think they feel 
like sensible estimates of the boundaries of the actual number, though the larger one is
perhaps closer to the truth.</p>

<h2 id="comparing-with-survey-results">Comparing with survey results</h2>
<p>When I shared these results on Twitter, there were some helpful pointers to attempts
to answer the same questions using surveys.</p>
<p>Nick Temple of the Social Investment Business estimates that 13% of their customer
base's employees are on furlough.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks for doing this David; even a rough guess is helpful. Recent analysis of our customer base came up with around 13% of all employees on furlough. Though SIB customer base tends to be medium, rather than small/micro.</p>&mdash; Nick Temple (@nicktemple1) <a href="https://twitter.com/nicktemple1/status/1271438133473705986?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 12, 2020</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Charity Tax Group &amp; Charity Retail suggest that many of the 26,000 charity shop employees
have been furloughed - the unique nature of these employees (similar private businesses
do not have retail employees) means that they are potentially missed from my estimate.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Based on recent discussions with <a href="https://twitter.com/CharityRetail?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CharityRetail</a> there are 26,000 FTE charity shop employees &amp; many of them have been furloughed. <a href="https://twitter.com/CivilSocietyUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CivilSocietyUK</a> estimated 20,000 from the 20 largest charities some time back. Very difficult to be certain though <a href="https://t.co/FZhj3jdC0e">https://t.co/FZhj3jdC0e</a></p>&mdash; Charity Tax Group (@CharityTaxGroup) <a href="https://twitter.com/CharityTaxGroup/status/1271440561581498370?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 12, 2020</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>A Charity Tax Group survey showed 70% of respondents had made a claim.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This does not provide specific figures but a recent CTG snapshot poll showed high level of take-up organisationally (without specific responses on furloughed staff per charity) <a href="https://t.co/6Z7gxsMeab">pic.twitter.com/6Z7gxsMeab</a></p>&mdash; Charity Tax Group (@CharityTaxGroup) <a href="https://twitter.com/CharityTaxGroup/status/1271441766068166656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 12, 2020</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>66% of respondents to <a href="https://www.probonoeconomics.com/news/pbe-launches-new-survey-understand-impact-covid-19-charity-sector">Pro Bono Economics</a> 
survey (9-10 June) said they had furloughed or used job retention scheme.</p>
<h2 id="what-next">What next?</h2>
<p>These estimates are probably wrong. They're based on imperfect data and assumptions that 
are unlikely to be correct. However, given the absence of better data, I think they give
an indication of the scale we would expect to see in figures.</p>
<p>ONS and HMRC have done a fantastic job during this crisis of producing statistics to
understand the environment and measure responses. But charities can often fall through the 
cracks in official statistics - due to lack of data, or because they're not thought about
when the measures are designed.</p>
<p>I'd like to see better official data on charities in this crisis, to help the charity 
sector measure the impact and respond. </p>
